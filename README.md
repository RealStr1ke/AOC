# Advent of Code

![Advent of Code Banner](assets/images/aoc-banner.jpeg)

Hi! This is my repository for my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. 

## Usage

You can find my solutions in the [`events`](events) folder. Each yearly event has its own folder, and each day has its own folder within that. Each day folder contains the input I was given for the challenge and the program I made to calculate my solution (could be any language I choose). I'll also include a `README.md` file in each day folder that explains the challenge (with a link) and my solution whenever I get around to it.

**Note:** If you see any gaps in the days, it's either because I haven't gotten around to solving it correctly, or I'm still rewriting it for readability. 

## Contributing

I'll most likely not be accepting pull requests to my solution code other than cleanup or optimization (maybe), but you may contribute to the repository by editing the `README.md` files. If you see a typo, something that could be worded better, or just innacuracies with the explanations, feel free to open a pull request with your changes. I'll review it and merge it if I like it. If you have a suggestion for a different solution to a challenge, you may open an issue and I'll take a look at it, but I won't be making new solution files, I'll probably just be explaning other routes to the solution in the `README.md` file.
